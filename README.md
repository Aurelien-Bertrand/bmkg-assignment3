### Implementation
This repository comprises code to run our system designed for the third assignment of our Building and Mining Knowledge Graph course (KEN 4256).

**The system works as follows:**

Given a Knowledge Graph (KG) and two input questions, formulate a SPARQL queries to answer both of them, perform multi-hop reasoning on the KG to identify links or relations between both results and write a short paragraph with context around it.
